# SK32144 Driver Library

A C library for programming and controlling SK32144 registers.

> **Educational Purpose Only**  
> This project is created for learning and educational purposes. It is not intended for production use.

## Overview

This project provides a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) for the SK32144 microcontroller, enabling easy configuration and control of peripheral registers through a well-defined C API. 

This is a learning project designed to demonstrate best practices in embedded C programming, register-level programming, and hardware abstraction layer design.

## Features

- Complete register definitions and bit masks
- Type-safe API with error handling
- Structure-based and address-based register access
- Comprehensive bit manipulation macros
- Interrupt management functions
- Low-level hardware abstraction
- Well-documented code with examples
